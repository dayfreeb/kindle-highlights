He will go there one day, James thinks suddenly. He'll go there, and stand where Teddy stood. Where countless thousands have stood before them. Where wars have been waged, and bombs dropped, and castles besieged. Where countless photographs have been taken, and memories forged, and lifetime experiences made. And somewhere, in this great timeline of history, in this vast ocean of wars and battles and celebrations, a boy sent another boy a postcard. I was standing atop this rock today, James.

Artists mixing colours and creating scenes that have never been done before, writers giving words to emotions that everyone feels but can’t describe, musicians creating chords and melodies out of silence.

I loved and cried and sang and danced once just like you. I was here. I was human. Remember me. Remember me.’

there was a bravery in that act alone. Getting up and facing each day and finding joy in the little things like art and Tchaikovsky when the whole world seemed jaded.

"You really thought that the only option was that I'd faked my death and had been hiding out and doing whatever traitorous things you thought I was doing?" "Yes", Barty says simply before gesturing at Regulus and raising his eyebrows, "and was I wrong?"

“Look, I don’t know a lot. I have no idea what happens when we die or what next week looks like, let alone hundreds of years in the future,” James began, studying the grey in Regulus’ eyes and the way his dark eyelashes brushed his cheeks with each blink. “But I do know that there’s still an us hundreds of years from now. We’re still together. That’s the only thing I know for sure.”

He hadn’t lived a long life. It was relatively short, in the grand scheme of things, but he wasn’t angry. He had experienced the love of a million lifetimes in the short amount of time he had known James. He had met the sun and known its warmth. It wasn’t a bad life. It was the best one he could’ve asked for. He was loved and he had loved in return. What a glorious and indelible thing to be a part of.

It wasn’t the amount of blood that had accumulated all over the floor that convinced James that Regulus was dead.  Or the fact that Regulus had stopped the gurgling and wheezing noises several minutes ago as he drifted into cruel stillness.  It wasn’t Barty’s tear stained and blood splattered face. Or Evan’s desperate attempts to shake Regulus awake. It wasn’t even Peter’s sorrowful look upon checking for a pulse. Or his frantic attempts to do CPR anyway.   It was Sirius’ agonised wails as he pleaded and called out to a God he never believed in to spare his brother. To bring him back.  “I just got him back,” Sirius screamed. “I just got him back. Please. Don’t do this. Please bring him back. I just got him back.”

Barty and Evan made good on their promise to attend the funeral. They came bursting into their seats late, stumbling, drunk, and using each other for support. Red swollen eyes, stubbly faces, crooked ties. And James felt a new wave of grief strike him all over again because Sirius wasn’t the only one who had lost a brother that night. Barty and Evan had too.

James had all these little pieces and fragments of Regulus that he loved more than anything in the world. But Barty had different pieces and so did Evan, and even though it hurt, even though every time someone said his name, James felt his heart wrench, they were helping each other to put the pieces together. Story by story, they were helping each other complete the picture of Regulus.

Barty and Evan.  Sleep.  Together.  In a California king sized bed.  “James? You alright?”  “Uhm, yeah. Yeah,” James blinked rapidly. “Yeah, I’m great. I just didn’t know you and Evan were, like, together. I-I mean, that’s great! I’m very happy for you both,” James stammered. Barty arched both of his eyebrows at him.  “Uhm, how long have you been dating?” James was flailing.  “We’re married.”  “Shut the fuck up,”

Barty stumbled into the kitchen to grab a photograph off the fridge. He placed it in front of James.  It was a picture of both him and Evan kissing as an Elvis impersonator wearing dark sunglasses gave a giant thumbs up.  “I cannot believe it was bloody legally binding, but it was,” Barty laughed. Barty laughed and then Evan laughed and then James laughed too. He laughed so hard he had to wipe the tears from his eyes. Regulus would’ve fucking loved this.  “Well, we have to do something!

‘Hang painting here?’ James imagined Regulus running around this house, jetlagged from the flight from Amsterdam and ridiculously tired with a pad of bright pink sticky notes and a pen. Regulus had accounted for everything. Every small detail of their new life and their new house was catalogued and planned. The only thing Regulus didn’t account for, was the fact that he wouldn’t be in it.

He wasn’t sure he wanted to give up this lifetime yet. This one and all it’s spectacular memories.  “I’ll let you in on a little secret,” Regulus whispered standing up and leading James to the row of doors. “I’ve had a long time to look through some of these doors. A long time to look at the lifetimes we still have waiting for us, and you’re going to love this one,” Regulus pointed to a short brown door with a golden handle. “It’s one of my favourites too.”
