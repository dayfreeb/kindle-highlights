I used to think there was such a thing as emptiness, that there were places in the world one could go and be alone. This, I think, is still true, but the error in my reasoning was to assume that alone was somewhere you could go, rather than somewhere you had to be left.

I want to explain her in a way that would make you love her, but the problem with this is that loving is something we all do alone and through different sets of eyes.

Something I learned very quickly was that grieving was complicated by lack of certainty, that the hope inherent in a missing loved one was also a species of curse. People posted about children who had gone missing upwards of fifteen years ago and whose faces were now impossible to conjure, about friends who had messaged to confirm a meeting place and then simply never showed up. In almost every case, the sense of loss was convoluted by an ache of possibility, by the almost-but-not-quite-negligible hope of reprieve. Deus ex machina – the missing loved one thrown back down to earth. Grief is selfish: we cry for ourselves without the person we have lost far more than we cry for the person – but more than that, we cry because it helps. The grief process is also the coping process and if the grief is frozen by ambiguity, by the constant possibility of reversal, then so is the ability to cope.

In truth, we will only perform any action a certain number of times, and to know that can never be helpful. There is, in my opinion, no use in demanding to know the number, in demanding to know upon waking the number of boxes to be ticked off every single day. After all, why would it help to be shown the mathematics of things, when instead we could simply imagine that whatever time we have is limitless.

When something bad is actually happening, it’s easy to underreact, because a part of you is wired to assume it isn’t real. When you stop underreacting, the horror is unique because it is, unfortunately, endless.

Regulus has always been very good at hiding things, at least from the moment he had things to hide. When he's scared, when he's hurt, when he's nervous, when he's feeling anything he deems a weakness—he knows exactly how to hide it, to cover it up so he looks calm, neutral, completely uncaring.

"I think—I don't know, maybe if our lives had gone differently, maybe we would have ended up together. You and me, I mean. That's wishful thinking, isn't it?"  Regulus rolls a berry in between his fingers, thoughtful. He knows what James means. If Sirius hadn't volunteered, if the games hadn't existed at all, what would they be now? He thinks he knows, and it's sort of heartwrenching. "No, that's not wishful thinking. I think you're right."  "What? Really?" James bolts up, his eyes wide as he stares at him in blatant shock. "You—I mean, you really think so?"  "Like I told you," Regulus says, "we're a great, big tragedy."

The hand closes around his dagger, and the only thing Regulus can think is, no one ever thinks to look up.  Fuck.  Frantically, Regulus tries to buck the person on him off, but he only succeeds in half-turning over, the person on top rocking with the motion and using the momentum to slam Regulus to the ground flat on his back. Vaguely, Regulus recognizes the man as one that didn't really speak to anyone, and now here he is, raising Regulus' dagger up and clearly getting ready to bring it back down. Regulus scrambles to reach for his third dagger, and then a hatchet is sticking out of the man's head.  It's just there, suddenly. Regulus barely even saw it swing in, like he blinked and missed the moment it was buried into the man's skull. There's a hand still gripping the handle, and Regulus knows that hand. He has that hand memorized.  James.

"We'll be home really soon, love. Together, we'll get there."  "I know," Regulus murmurs, reaching out to grab James' hand, squeezing it. He waits for James to squeeze back before leaning in to close the last bit of distance between their lips.  This time, Regulus kisses James like he means it. Like he can't help it. Like he's never wanted anything more. He lifts both hands and cradles James' face, curling forward into him to kiss him slow and sweet, savoring the way his lips part around a soft sigh. When Regulus feels the tear roll down James' cheek, hitting his finger, he gently brushes it away. It's their secret. No one will ever know but them.  It's devastating that a tear shed in heartbreak is the only thing that they get to have for themselves, but Regulus isn't sure what else he was expecting. This is what they are.  A great, big tragedy.

Things like this can only exist in the dark, in the dead of night where the whole world seems to be in a slumber, that way it's easier to pretend no one can see how he unravels. Regulus tries his best, he really does, but there's genuinely nothing he can do. It just comes pouring out of him, and he wonders why now? Because of the dream? There were so many layers to the dream that Regulus doesn't even bother trying to make sense of them. So, why is he losing it over Evan now? Again? He thought he already did this. He can't keep doing this.  That's the thing about grief, Regulus is learning. It doesn't just go away. He doesn't just get to be upset when it happens; he has to go on and be upset for the rest of his life. It's not fair.

"You're hesitating, love," James says softly.  Regulus releases a rattling breath. He hasn't even raised his dagger. He's trembling. His vision is blurring. This is it, isn't it? The real test. Because it's just them now, the last two, and James is the only thing standing between him and home. He's always said he would do what he had to, always said he would kill James if that's what it came to. Without hesitation. And yet.  The truth—the horrible, ugly, gut wrenching truth—is that Regulus can't. He thought—he really thought he would, he thought he could, if that's what it came down to; that's an easy thing to believe when he was so sure it wouldn't come down to that. But here they are, and Regulus was wrong.  "I—I can't," Regulus chokes out, and the dagger falls from his grip to land on the ground, never to be picked up again. He won't pick it up. "James, I can't."  James' face softens, and his gaze is so warm, despite the pain that tightens the corner of them. His lips curl up further, and he murmurs, "That's okay, Regulus."  "No, it's not," Regulus croaks. "Nothing about this is okay. I can't do it. I can't kill you. I—James, I—"  "Shh, don't worry about it. You don't have to," James whispers, slowly turning to face him.  Regulus' gaze trails down to where James is cupping his stomach, blood pouring through the crevices of his fingers, spilling over his hand. "James?"

"Lift your arm for me."  James responds to the words like a puppet on strings, his arm raising as his breath rattles in his chest. He's struggling to breathe, Regulus can hear it, and it's not just from some kiss. He's surely in pain, especially now that Regulus is straddling him, and yet he remains compliant, happy to participate. As a reward, Regulus dips in and kisses him again.  It is admittedly quite fucked up, because it's to distract him, too. James is so caught up in the kiss that he doesn't realize what's happening, so there's nothing he can do when there's a distinct click and clang of metal on metal. James' mouth goes still against his own, and Regulus eases back with a shaky exhale, watching James blink rapidly and tilt his head up to stare at where Regulus has handcuffed him to the pole.  The pole has hooks that the supplies were hanging off of, which means James can't just stand and ride the handcuffs up and off the pole. He's stuck.  James gives a small tug in visible confusion, looking at where he's trapped with no understanding of what's happening. He pulls again, seemingly instinctively, then frowns and looks at Regulus. For a moment, neither of them speak, and Regulus feels his heart break a little bit, because he's about to shatter James' for the second time—and this time, he's choosing to.  "This is not how I expected myself to go, if I'm honest," James mumbles, eyebrows furrowed. "Reg, what are you doing?"  Regulus swallows and folds forward to press a gentle kiss to James' forehead, his hands coming up to frame James' face and hold his head still. When he pulls back, he meets James' gaze and gives him a wobbly smile. "Sirius needs you, James. Your parents need you. The world—the whole fucking world needs you. The only place you're going is home."

Regulus realizes very quickly why it only takes two minutes for those in the crimson river to die—because it's not just the drowning one has to worry about. It's also the hands yanking at him, claws dipping in deep and ripping at his skin, trying to pull him apart. They're relentless, ruthless, and he can't stop himself from opening his mouth to scream underwater, lungs protesting and pain exploding in every limb. Except it's not water, it's blood, and it's thick in his mouth as he swallows it and swallows it, instinctively trying to survive even now, just as he has been this entire time. There are hands raking at his chest, one pushing in like it's trying to get to his heart and snatch it right out like a trophy—and that's exactly what it's doing, he realizes. And that's how he will die. Heartless.  No one can hear him beneath the surface, but his muffled, water-logged screams take the shape of a name. In his panic, in his haze of pain, it's Sirius he instinctively calls for.  ~•~

"Listen to me, okay, Regulus?" Sirius says firmly. "I love you. You're my brother; of course I love you. Always have, always will, and nothing—absolutely nothing in this world could ever change that, do you hear me? You're enough for me, and I love you. Never, never fucking doubt that."  Regulus stares up at him for a moment before promptly bursting into tears all over again, his whole body deflating like a popped balloon. He ducks his head forward and presses the top of it to Sirius' chest like he's five instead of twenty-five, hiding away from the world. Sirius loosens his arms a bit in case he's actually hurting him, but gently scrubs his hand back and forth over Regulus' head.  For a long time, neither of them move. Regulus eventually stops crying, his heaving shoulders just—drooping. Sirius feels like a weight has just lifted off his chest, which is ironic because the top of Regulus' head is still resting there, but that's neither here nor there. The important bit is, Sirius has told Regulus that he loves him, because he didn't get to before, and he's so grateful that he gets the chance to now.  Sirius doesn't need Regulus to say it back. He knows. Just from all that's happened between Regulus asking Remus to take care of him, and Regulus admitting to Evan that he missed him, and Regulus begging James to live for him—yeah, Sirius knows. Even now, just this, the way Regulus leans into him like Sirius is his port in a storm, a shelter to crawl into for safety when the winds grow too harsh; the way just hearing that Sirius loves him is enough to make him weep so deeply, so wholeheartedly, that the touch of grief is almost worth it.  Regulus doesn't say it back, but Sirius hears it anyway, hears it in all the ways it's said without words, and always has been for years, even wrapped in pain and anger. Sirius doesn't expect Regulus to say it back, because he's Regulus, and he always struggled to say such things, even long before all of this. Sirius has the same issue at times, likely from the way they grew up, but he's had something that Regulus purposefully distanced himself from—James Potter's influence. So, Sirius can say it, and Regulus doesn't have to. What matters is that Sirius hears the response loud and clear, echoing over the distance, after all this time they spent unable to meet halfway. He hears it.  He knows.

"He chose me," James rasps, looking at Sirius with wide eyes, big and brown and swirling with emotion. "He didn't say he loved me, but he said something like it, I think, and I… Sirius, I still don't know what any of it means. Somehow, I'm still fucking confused, and I'm—I'm so angry at him. I begged him not to do it, and he still… Why would he do that?"  Because he loves you, Sirius thinks, but he forces himself not to say it, because that's not fair. It's one thing to say it to Regulus about James, who made it very obvious, who stated it right to his face multiple times. It's something else to say it to James for Regulus, who didn't say it, who showed it with actions, but it's not that simple with him. Love is very different for Regulus than it is for James, and that's something they have to figure out together, if they want to, if they even can. The thing is, Sirius doesn't know if Regulus is going to be willing to.

"Oh," Regulus chokes out with a harsh, pained laugh, breathless as he rocks back to stare at James, who is looking right at him, beseeching. "This is going to hurt."  And it is. Of course it is, because they're a great, big tragedy. That's what they are; that's what they've always been; that's all they'll ever get to be. There's no changing that now, no matter what they do, no matter how hard they try.  They were going to try.

"I love you, Reggie," Sirius murmurs with a sad smile and a gentle shrug, because really, that's what it comes down to. He does. He loves his brother so very much. Just once, selfishly, he wishes Regulus would say it back. Regulus doesn't.  "You are dead to me," Regulus whispers instead.  Sirius fights against the wave of pain that crashes over him from those words, telling himself it's for the best. After all, he'll actually be dead very soon, because whoever he's going in with, he'll be sure to get them out.  Without a word, Regulus drops his arm and lets him go so he can walk to the front and take his place. Again.  Sirius does.

"For district six's second tribute…" Pandora exhales shakily through her tears and fumbles with the paper to open it. She releases a low whine, her head ducking forward, and James' eyes sink shut as his preemptive devastation wreaks havoc on him. After a heavy pause, Pandora whispers, "J—" "I volunteer." James feels his entire body go cold. Like the sun dying. Flames extinguished. The whole world going dark.  No.  No, not this.  Please not this.  James turns slowly and looks at Regulus, who meets his gaze steadily, unwavering.

It hits him now, like this, that he doesn't want to die, and more than that, he doesn't deserve to. Not now. Not like this. Not here. He doesn't, and Sirius doesn't, and none of them do.  It's on the edge of death that it becomes clear how desperate one is to live. No one wants to die, not really. It's one thing to say it, to think it, to feel it—but humans are creatures of endurance. They endure, and endure, and endure. It's instinct. It's the fear of the unknown and the desire for more.  People are born to live, and destined to die.

"You were the point. The way he made his tea was the point. How he sang happily the first morning after we moved in together was the point. All the times he held you in his arms, and every kiss he gave me, and each time he smiled at Sirius—that was the point. James, death does not erase the point of life. A dead flower does not mean it never bloomed. It did, and it was beautiful."

James didn't cry at his dad's funeral. It didn't feel…like his dad, so maybe that's why. They'd dressed Monty up in something warm and nice, and his face was set into something peaceful, and it—that wasn't James' dad. It just wasn't. James' dad was gone, is gone, and they closed the casket on an echo of him and lowered him into the ground, and James didn't cry. James didn't speak. James didn't throw dirt into his grave, asked Sirius to do it for him, just sat in the front row with Regulus' hand in his, then stood up and let people tell him how sorry they were for his loss. He thought of Alice. Sorry really is like a slap in the face, more than he ever realized.

Euphemia feels a noise crawl out of her throat, harsh and gutted like her chest is littered with the same bullets as his. She can feel it burning, the invasion of something she wants to dig her nails in and claw out, one-by-one. It hurts. In all her life, of all the pain she has suffered, nothing has ever hurt the way this does. It's been seconds. Only seconds have passed. "I'll be there," Fleamont whispers. "I can't wait to see our boys get married. Can't wait to meet our grandchildren. Can't wait to watch you live in a better world. You'll live, honey, and you'll know so much love, because so many people love you. And I love you, wherever I am. I'm sorry you won't be able to see me, but I'll be right there, okay?"  Euphemia sniffs hard, exhaling shakily and shifting to cradle his jaw, holding his head up, because he can't anymore. She leans in and kisses him, gentle, steady. When she pulls away, his mouth curves at the corners, and she gently lets his head rest against her shoulder. She closes her eyes and holds him.

"If there's one thing I've learned, though, impermanence only solidifies importance. You can learn through loss to better cherish what you have, and be thankful for what you got. It's awful, mostly, but you look back and there are glimpses that you can't bring yourself to regret. The inevitability of endings can't remove all that came before it. That still exists, and we get that, and we keep that. And that's—that's special. That's precious."

"Would you marry me?" Regulus says softly, just gazing at him, his hair spilled out around his head and face in waves, eyes fixed right on him. He doesn't look like someone who just asked that question; there's no warning for it, just a simple desire to have an answer. Not will you marry me, because James can't, but would you marry me, if you could? Then and now, before everything and after, during and always—would he?  "Yes," James whispers.  Regulus' lips curl up, and then they keep curling up, and then they curl out of control until a broad, beaming smile breaks across his face in a bloom of the most beautiful thing James has ever seen. He's grinning. It's a goofy grin, one of delight and the sweetest joy James has ever been hit with. Regulus' face flushes, pleased and flustered like he's still a young boy with a crush, eyes lit up as he sucks in a deep breath and holds it. He looks like he wants to scream, but in a good way; he looks like James feels just looking at him, so in love that he's glowing from the inside out from it.  James huffs out a helpless, stunned laugh of pure amazement, the rush of it spreading to him as well, despite the fact that it's the last night and everything will fall apart tomorrow. And yet, somehow, that doesn't really matter right now, like this, when happiness can grow even in the harshest of conditions, when it exists between them so blatantly with something as simple as a possibility they may never get to have.  The palpable giddiness and excitement from Regulus does not wane. If anything, it just grows stronger until he's scooting almost frantically across the space between them to kiss James eagerly, earnestly, utterly breathless and happy. So happy.  Right now, there's no room for tragedy between them.

James stares at him, his body strung tight as he glares right into his eyes, and then he makes a furious, frustrated noise and takes the three strides he needs to reach Regulus. It's easy, meeting him halfway with an open-mouthed, teeth-clacking kiss that they both moan into the moment it connects. James hooks a hand behind his neck and holds him there. Regulus never wants him to let go.

When I talk about love, I don't mean romantic love exclusively, you know that, don't you? Love is—it's not just romance. It's in...everything. Life. The breeze. Sunshine and snow. It's everywhere, in us and around us, even just...blood. Love can be blood, too. Blood spilt. Blood in our veins. Blood flowing in the people around us."  Regulus stares at him, his eyes a little wide, lips parted a bit. Honestly, it makes James feel ridiculously flustered. Regulus looks—well, there he is, a star, and he's starstruck. James feels his stomach go all topsy-turvy from a sudden migration of butterflies, and he has to violently clear his throat before continuing. "What I mean to say is, no matter what the Hallows think, romantic love isn't some goal everyone should feel the need to meet. Some people don't feel that way, and that doesn't mean there's no love in their life. No one needs romantic love to be fulfilled as a person. Not everyone wants it, and then there are those who aren't ready, and all of it is okay. That doesn't mean there's an absence of love, or that you're getting it wrong. You're not, Regulus, I promise."

It makes sense, in a way, because love is a universal truth. It is, despite everything, what most—if not all—people can agree on, in that people feel the call of it. People find hope in it. People believe in love, almost instinctively, because love exists all around them. In families, in friends, in lovers. There's so much love in life, and it's what makes living worth it.

Vanity collapses back, making a horrible gurgling noise, and Hodge gasps as he stumbles to the side, dropping his knife. James goes barreling over, finally reaching them. He doesn't mean to do it. That's the thing. He just shoves Hodge further away, not even aware of his own strength in his state of panic, and—and Hodge is so small, he's only fourteen— James doesn't know what he's done until there's a splash. His head whips around as he hits his knees by Vanity, and he only gets one glimpse of Hodge in the water before the hands are dragging him down, just like Willa. James sucks in a sharp breath, left reeling from the sight and the realization that he just mindlessly pushed Hodge into the river.  He would have turned fifteen tomorrow.  It takes a minute, even longer than Willa—likely due to the fast-acting venom from Vespa—but then the cannon sounds, leaving Hodge eternally fourteen.  Another choked noise snatches James' attention back to Vanity. She's staring up at him in pure fear, throat coated with blood, some bubbling up from her mouth. James makes a weak noise and shakily cups her throat with his hand, his eyes blurring with tears as he lifts her up a little to cradle her head against his legs. She tries to speak, but no words come out.  "Shh, it's okay. You're okay," James whispers, his voice cracking. A wet breath escapes him, his chest feeling like it's caving in. "You're—you're going to be—"  Vanity's eyes glaze over, and the cannon sounds. She's limp against him, no pulse in her throat, no breath causing her chest to rise and fall.  "No, no, I'm—I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. Vanity, I'm—" James chokes off because he can't speak through his own tears. He ducks his head forward, sobbing over her helplessly.  Sobbing.  Sobbing.  Sobbing.  She never got her first kiss.  She never got to fall in love. She never got to go home.  Her prince never saved her.  Her prince killed her.

In the end, Regulus can't figure out what to say, but if there's one thing he knows about James, it's that he's a very tactile person. Touch—he loves it, any kind, any place, any form. He's greedy for it, whether that's giving it to others or getting it; just a point of contact pleases him.  So, Regulus pulls away and, because it's getting darker, he grabs his blanket from his bag and stands up to step over James and settle on his other side. James blinks at him, clearly not understanding what the fuck he's doing, but he makes no complaints when Regulus carefully tucks the blanket under his bad leg, pulling it up over his arm. He then stands up and steps back over before settling in up against James as carefully as possible, trying not to jostle him too much.  "Sit up a bit," Regulus murmurs, and James does, though he still looks confused.  The expression of bewilderment melts into brief delight when Regulus slips his arm around him from where he leans up and gently pulls him back. James is essentially tucked up against his side, scooted down a little due to his leg, and he has the space to lean his head over on Regulus' shoulder. Regulus encourages him to do so wordlessly by raising the arm around him and sinking his fingers into James' hair, pushing his head over as he kneads at his scalp. James pretty much melts.  "Oh," James breathes out. "That's—that's really nice."  Regulus doesn't respond. He just uses his free hand to tug the blanket up over them both, tucking it in under him so they're as snug as they're going to get. He keeps running his fingers through James' hair and looks off to the side, like he can ignore what's happening if he's not looking. Not once has Regulus held James, not like this. He's allowed James to hold him, and that's it, because that's different somehow.  But, if this is all he can do, if this is all he can offer as a form of comfort, then do it he shall. He doesn't know what to say, but maybe he doesn't have to say anything at all.

In a way, James is almost relieved. As much as he would have liked to go home, he's come to terms with the fact that he wouldn't be able to once, so it's easy to do again. He accepts it with no fuss, just as he did when he made his choice from the very beginning. It's okay, he thinks. It's going to be okay.  Because, see, James did it. James helped Regulus make it to the end. All that he set out to do at the start, and he's done it. He didn't fail. Regulus is alive, and he's going to go home.  On the bright side, at least Regulus won't have to kill him. At least James knows for sure now that Regulus can't, and even with that fact, it's not an issue. James is bleeding out, slowly but surely, and Regulus doesn't have to worry about a thing. Though, honestly, James had meant it when he said that he wishes it had been Regulus. Maybe it's a strange, pyschosexual thing, but he feels like he's sort of been flirting with Regulus and his daggers this entire time, so to be stabbed by him would surely have been more satisfying. Regulus would have made sure James felt it, adrenaline or not. He isn't sure why that's so attractive to him, but it really is.  Maybe James is in shock. Maybe James actually does have a knife kink. Maybe James is just in love, and he wants anything he can get from Regulus, even if it's literal death.

I think he was probably lonely, said Michael. What with the ear thing and the darkness. I think he was, too, said Dora. 1888 was the year, and he was waiting for another artist to join him, a man called Paul Gauguin. People say that, in all probability, he painted the Sunflowers as decoration for Gauguin’s room. Did lots of versions of them too, not just this. It’s a lovely thought, though, isn’t it? Some people say it’s not true but I like to think it is. Painting flowers as a sign of friendship and welcome. Men and boys should be capable of beautiful things.

“Oi, Christopher?” Sirius shot him a very wicked look. “Dare me to snog Moony?” “Wha-- I--?!” Christopher looked stricken, as if he knew there was a joke somewhere, but he couldn’t figure out the punchline. Sirius wasted no time. He took Remus’s head, roughly, and pulled him in for a kiss. Remus gave in. It was a bit mean, but he could hardly refuse. If it was a test of loyalty, or simply something Sirius thought would be funny, he had to go along with it. “Oh for merlin’s sake!” A voice came from further up the corridor, causing Sirius and Remus to spring apart. “I’m away for a week and the castle turns into an orgy!” All three boys spun around to see Marlene standing there in her travelling cloak, duffle bag at her side. She gave them a knowing smirk, “What a load of queers.”

“Was it scary? Was I scary?” He had no idea what he looked like in wolf form. Sirius’s expression did not flicker. “No.” He said, firmly. “You were beautiful.”

“Tell you what I’ve missed,” he said, a smile playing on his lips - that Sirius Black grin - “Smoking. Haven’t got a fag, have you?” “They’re bad for you.” Remus tutted. “They kill you.” “We’re all dying,” Sirius replied. “Maybe.” Remus agreed, lacing their fingers together, “But shouldn’t life last longer, if it can be like this?”

“Have you ever kissed anyone, Remus?” “No, you know I haven’t.” The lie came easily now. Sirius nodded, looking at him again, that forward, knowing look. “It’s really not as scary as you think it is.” Sirius said. Remus couldn’t bear it. He might never know what came over him in that moment. It was all just too much and he grabbed the back of the other boy’s neck and pulled him forward, pressing his lips hard against Sirius’s. It was terrifying – and amazing. Even more so when Sirius began kissing him back, opening his lips and allowing Remus to slide his tongue inside. It was all at once startling, incredible, and familiar. He couldn't think – as if every transmitter in his brain had short circuited at once, fizzing and popping; sending off sparks. Yes, was the only coherent thought he had; yes yes yes yes. They came to their senses simultaneously, both pulling away. Remus snatched back his hand, Sirius stared at him wide-eyed. Remus looked away first. “I’d better—” Sirius started back towards the common room, “—Yeah, I was just…” Remus backed away, up the stairs. Sirius disappeared back towards the party and Remus exhaled deeply, feeling he might sink to the floor. He ran his fingers through his hair and wiped his mouth. He rubbed his eyes and fought the urge to punch the wall. What had he been playing at?! Sirius would think he was completely mad – or worse. He’d never done anything like that before. Maybe he was mad.

Sirius’s footfall on the stairs disrupted his thoughts. Remus licked his lips, remembering that kiss from earlier. Ah. There was always that. The ultimate distraction. Decision made, he stubbed out the cigarette and got up, striding purposefully across the room. He reached the door just as Sirius pushed it open - best not to even give him a chance. “Wotcher, Moony, just came to see if yo--” He shut him up with a fierce kiss, crushing their lips together, pulling him at the hips so that they were pressed hard against each other. “Oh, ok…” Sirius gasped, when he finally wrenched himself free. He kicked the door shut behind himself as Remus dragged him to the bed. It was good. Really, really good. Remus’s frustrated urgency was met with answering eagerness from Sirius, and they tore against each other, out of sync in the best possible way. Losing yourself in drink or drugs was nothing compared to losing yourself in Sirius Black. They’d been at this long enough now to know the edges of each others limits, and just how far they could push them. “Fuck.” Sirius groaned, when it was all over, and the windows were steamy and the waxing moon had risen outside. Remus reached for his fags once more, still buzzing, his hot skin humming. “Fuck.” Sirius said again, on his back, staring up. Beautiful mess. “What brought that on?” “Just you.” Remus replied, exhaling smoke. “Just wanted it.” “Not complaining.” Remus settled back, smoking quietly. This was good. This was better, anyway, than anything else he could be doing. He was still restless, though. A bit more tired, but fidgety and unsettled. He could go again. He could go all night, if it would shut his brain up. That made him glance at the door - they hadn’t shut the curtains, and by some miracle got away with it. “Where are the others?” “Mm?” Sirius’s eyes had drifted shut, but he stirred awake, valiantly, “Oh, er… Pete’s three rounds into a chess game with a second year who’s obviously some sort of evil mastermind, Mary went to bed, and Prongs and the missus have gone to the prefect’s bathrooms. They thought they were being subtle.” He chuckled lightly under his breath.

“No one owes you a happy life." Remus mournfully parroted Matron’s old adage as they swayed down the hall together. "No," Grant huffed, setting him into bed. He looked down at Remus pityingly, "But you owe yourself one, love.”

Not a single day went by – and not one day would ever go by, for many years – that he did not think of Sirius and suffer. It was an abstract and cruel torture, and Remus resigned himself to a life of utter misery. Everywhere he looked he was haunted by thoughts and memories of his friends, of the things they could never do, and the things he had not done in time. He attended the funeral - a joint one for Lily and James, followed by a memorial for Peter. Remus sat at the back, and left before the wake, in case anyone tried to speak to him. He was terrified that someone might ask him about Sirius - might ask him what he knew. Or tell him something he didn’t want to know. So Remus did not stay to reminisce, or ‘celebrate’ his friends’ lives, (honestly, what a despicable idea). He went home alone, and got drunk. He got drunk every day for weeks. He stayed at the flat in Soho – he had no choice in the matter; no money, no family. No friends. The Order disbanded and those who still had lives worth living didn’t want to know him. He couldn’t find any work in the wizarding world and – never having felt at home in it anyway – chose to withdraw. After learning about the fate of the Longbottoms in the Daily Prophet, he stopped reading the papers. He did not re-connect to the floo network, he did not use magic at all unless he really had to. He never went to Diagon Alley, and for all intents and purposes lived as a muggle. Mary sent postcards from Jamaica, from Trinidad, from Saint Lucia - she seemed to have family all over the Caribbean. She kept saying sorry. Remus didn’t know what for; they’d both lost the same things. At least she cared enough to get in touch. Dumbledore actually did try to contact him a couple of times, but Remus deliberately made himself difficult to reach. He was furious at the old man, who as far as Remus was concerned had never lifted a finger to help. Who had thrust them all into the war, young as they were, and stupid as they were, and who watched them die one by one without so much as blinking. Even the baby, Harry, was quickly tidied away into some anonymous corner of Surrey. The marauders might never have existed at all. Better that they hadn’t. For a while, Remus wondered when it would end. After long enough, he realised it never would, and so just tried to dull the pain. It might have been selfish, but what else was left but to be selfish? He had sacrificed plenty.

“Why did you do that?” A voice behind them spoke. Regulus had actually left the Slytherin table to confront his brother. Sirius ignored him, instead continuing to eat his food. “Sirius.” Regulus said, louder this time, “Why did you burn that letter?” “C’mon, Mary,” Sirius said, standing up again, carefully avoiding eye contact, “Let’s go, we’ve got Charms next, haven’t we?” “It wasn’t from mum,” Regulus said, his eyes overbright and his cheeks turning unnaturally pink, “I wrote it myself, I wanted to see you.” But Sirius was having none of it, and had already swept away from the table, Mary on his arm.

“We’re all there,” he says finally, still not looking at James. He wants so badly to ask him to explain but he doesn’t. He keeps waiting. After several painful minutes Regulus goes on; “Me, Sirius, my father—we’re all there, together, holding up the night sky,” he shakes his head, picking apart his fingers in his lap. “I started coming up here in second year, when Sirius stopped talking to me. Up there we’re still…whole. I don’t know. It makes me think that maybe in a different time, a different world, there’s an us that’s still—there’s a place that’s not like this.”

“I’m not my brother,” Regulus says eventually, grey eyes darting up to meet James’s. Surprised by the sudden change in topic, it takes James a minute to respond. “I know.” “Just, if that’s why—if that’s what—“ he stops, face scrunching in frustration as he attempts to get his thoughts in order. “If that’s why you’re doing this, if you think you can…save me, the way you did him. You should know that you can’t.” James feels his thoughts go in a million different directions at those words, unsure of what to address first. “Do you need to be saved Reg?” he manages finally. He isn’t sure what he’s expecting, but it’s certainly not the sad smile that peeks out of the corner of Regulus’s mouth. “Goodnight, Potter.”

“You take it on too easily,” James says eventually, when he’s certain he’ll be able to keep his voice under control. Regulus sends him a questioning look so he continues. “The role of the villain, like you think you deserve it. Like you’re trying to atone for something. Your family’s guilt isn’t your own Regulus, you don’t have to bear it. You aren’t them.” Something complicated is happening in the other boy’s eyes, and James wishes he knew what it was. “Sometimes,” his voice gets even quieter, eyes closing, “I think I was born with blood on my hands.” James wants so desperately to reach out, to pull him close, to hold him. But he doesn’t. Because Regulus doesn’t want that. Because he trusts James not to. “You’ve been saving me,” he says instead, the next best thing. If he can’t wrap him in his arms he’ll wrap him in his words. “These past few weeks, everything that’s been going on with Sirius, if it weren’t for you I’d be sunk,” he takes in a deep breath, leaning closer but still not touching, it’s Regulus who ends up bringing their foreheads together. “You’re not bad Regulus.” The other boy lets out a dry laugh. “Maybe,” there are fault lines in his voice, ready to shake him apart, “but I don’t think I’m good either.” “Reg,” James whimpers, voice breaking. He has no idea what they’ve been telling him at Grimmauld Place, but he knows it’s fucked him up, made him think he’s something he isn’t. It hurts, he realizes, to love someone who can’t love themselves. Like watching a work of art set itself on fire. They stay like that, frozen, pressed together. James closes his eyes and listens to Regulus breathe, surprised by how comforting it is. He doesn’t know how much time passes before Regulus steps back. “You’re my person,” he says suddenly, like it’s a struggle. Talking always is for him. James blinks. “What?” “You wanted to know what you are to me,” Regulus explains, flush high in his cheeks. “You’re my person. You’re mine.” James feels a smile tug at his mouth, something fluttering in his stomach. “Okay Reg,” he says warmly, “yeah, I’m yours. You’re mine too.” The other boy nods, exhaling, like he’d been worried. James can’t imagine why. He’s completely gone on the kid, he thought he’d made that clear.

“I believe in you,” he says quietly. The wind pushes against James, rocking him like a boat. “What?” “You said you missed having someone out here who believes in you—who has faith in you,” he puts weight in his words, so that they don’t float away, so that James has to hear them. “I have faith in you.” And then he’s gone, flying past James and sending the Quaffle careening over his head towards one of the Slytherin Chasers. James blinks, trying to get his bearings. I have faith in you. Those words bounce around his head. Those words set fires in his chest. And then, slowly, James feels himself smile. “POTTER!” Frank shouts, as James turns his broom around. “Get your head in the fucking game!” And he does.

“Eloquent as always James.” “Please, call me your majesty.” “I definitely am not going to do that.” James grins wickedly, “Aw come on Reg,” he tickles his side. “Don’t—James—“ he’s already giggling. “Come here pretty male lover,” he pulls a squirming Regulus on top of him, Regulus pitching forward, hands landing on either side of James’s face. Their eyes meet and hold, the world no bigger than this—this moment between them, this breath, this look. James reaches his hand up, fingers running through Regulus’s hair, swooping down to cup his face. “Will you bow to me Regulus?” he asks cheekily. “Mm,” Regulus turns and kisses the inside of his palm. “I could, but I’d rather get on my knees for you.”

“Je t’aime,” Regulus whispers, kissing behind his ear, “je t’aime, je t’aime, je t’aime.” Every word is punctuated with a kiss—quick and sweet. Under his jaw, along his neck, Regulus’s breath warm against his skin. James’s eyes flutter closed. “English,” the word punches out of him. “Just once. Say it in English once.” Regulus stills but doesn’t pull away, lips still brushing against James in an accidental way that sends shivers down his spine. Eventually Regulus props himself up on his elbows, looking at James like he’s the only thing in the world, and James can barely stand it. Regulus leans down and brings their mouthes together, slow and purposeful, ripping a gasp out of James when he pulls away. “I love you,” Regulus says, stare determined even as his voice shakes. “I’m sorry.” James doesn’t understand that, doesn’t know how to make sense of it over the blood rushing in his ears, the heart beating in his chest. “Don’t apologize,” he lifts himself up to Regulus’s mouth. “Don’t ever apologize for loving me.”

How did I never notice what a fucking star you are?” Regulus snorts. “Literally.” “Yeah,” James says without the sarcasm. “Yeah, but you are though.” Something shifts in Regulus’s expression that James doesn’t understand. They’re still so close, he can practically feel his breath. “Guess you weren’t looking,” Regulus says eventually. It takes a moment for James to realize what he’s saying. “Maybe,” he answers finally, “but I’m looking now.” In retrospect, he should have seen it coming. He didn’t. But he should have. The first thought he has when Regulus pushes forward, pressing their mouthes together, half crawling into James’s lap, is that he’s so warm. His mouth. His hands. For a boy who walks around like he’s made of stone Regulus touches like the sun.

Sometimes James, you shine so fucking bright I—I feel like I’m going to burn up.” Those words sink somewhere deep inside him. And he wants. And wants. And wants. “My whole life, everything has always been so cold and then you—you—and you started focusing it on me and I could feel it. Feel you watching me, feel you in my head, in my sleep. You take up so much space, you make everything so full. And it’s intoxicating. Just being around you, having all that power focused on me,” Regulus sounds breathless.

“James?” Regulus says softly, reaching up to press his hand to James’s face. “Sorry,” his voice is ragged. “Sorry, I’m a bit of a mess right now.” He drops his head, forehead resting against Regulus’s. “Good to know you’re human.” James goes to laugh but it gets trapped in his throat. “You wanna tell me what happened?” “Yes,” he’s whispering, like that’ll make it easier, “but I can’t.” Regulus’s thumb brushes against his cheek before his hand slowly trails down to James’s chest, gently pushing him down onto the bed. They lie facing one another. “I’m sorry,” James says again but Regulus just shakes his head. “You don’t have to apologize to me,” he leans forward, pressing a quick kiss to James’s mouth. Sweet. Innocent. It makes something in James sing. They just lie there for a minute, James trying to work out what the hell is going on with him, and Regulus just waiting. Eventually the younger boy reaches out, running his hand through James’s hair and James closes his eyes, leaning into the touch. “Sirius—hurt—someone,” the words are choked when they finally come out of him. Because he has to tell someone. Someone who isn’t directly involved. Because it’s eating him up inside. Regulus’s hand stills. “Did he hurt you?” Yes, James almost says, because it feels true.

“I don’t think important things are supposed to be easy,” he says, voice soft. He opens his eyes to find that Regulus has rolled onto his side as well. “You’re important Reg, you’re so fucking important. Especially to me.” Regulus’s eyes widen, thumb stilling. “Je ne te mérite pas,” he mumbles again. “What does that mean?” James asks, practically whispering, anything else would feel too loud in the fragile space that’s built up around them. Regulus looks back at him, grey eyes full of so much feeling they nearly swallow James whole. Eventually he exhales, propping himself up on his elbow and leaning down to press a chaste kiss to James’s mouth. He can taste the water. The sunlight. The sadness. Regulus pulls back, still leaning over him. “I said your hair looks ridiculous.” A choked laugh finds its way up James’s throat. “I don’t believe you,” he turns his head, kissing the palm of the hand that’s still holding him. Regulus smiles sadly. “Good.”

James has always been more of a gut feeling kind of person. Act now think later. So you see, he isn’t thinking when he reaches out, frustrated with Regulus for walking away. Walking away again. For not giving him a second to breathe. Or think. Mostly he just wants him to wait. But he doesn’t have a plan. He isn’t thinking. He’s following his gut. So when Regulus stumbles back towards him he doesn’t know how his hands find their way to the other boy’s face, doesn’t remember deciding to move forward, to press into him. Lips crashing together. This kiss is different. This time James feels all of it. Every inch of his body humming as Regulus opens his mouth and lets him inside. All James can think is yes. Yes this. Right here. Stay right here. Where I can keep you safe. Regulus’s nose is cold but the rest of him is still so warm and James can feel it pouring into him, filling his chest. There are universes in this kiss. It is big—gigantic. His hands slide into Regulus’s hair. He smells like fall. Like quidditch.

He admired anyone who could create, anyone who could make something that hadn’t existed before. Artists mixing colours and creating scenes that have never been done before, writers giving words to emotions that everyone feels but can’t describe, musicians creating chords and melodies out of silence. James loved it entirely too much and held on to the idea that it was the creatives of the world who would be remembered through their creations. Their books and paintings and music were all signs of humanness, all pockets of creation that stood to defy death. They screamed, ‘Hey, look at me! I was here once on this Earth too. I loved and cried and sang and danced once just like you. I was here. I was human. Remember me. Remember me.’

This painting, it’s like, the men are from three different time periods, in the same place, with the same moon. I like to think that they tell the moon all their secrets and she keeps them, all of them throughout the ages, faithfully. It has meaning. There’s no other way to depict the perseverance of the moon throughout human history without a bit of absurd surrealism.”

there was a bravery in that act alone. Getting up and facing each day and finding joy in the little things like art and Tchaikovsky when the whole world seemed jaded. He didn’t even need to borrow any bravery from James or anyone else, he had that kind of bravery all on his own.  James would look out the window and the rolling scenery and kiss Regulus every time the car came to a stop. Sometimes he would pull one of his hands up to his lips or he would lean over and kiss his cheek. He couldn’t help himself. He rested his hand on Regulus’ leg. He just wanted to be close to him. He was making up for lost time. Lost time when he would knock on Regulus’ door but not come in, not touch him. Lost time when he would sit across from him and drink tea but not hug him. He was sure these slight touches were adding to Regulus’ reckless driving, but it wasn’t a large enough deterrent to get him to stop. “Thank you,” James whispered looking over at Regulus. “For telling me everything today. I know it wasn’t easy.” Regulus let out a strangled noise in the back of his throat. For a moment James was worried that he had hurt him somehow with his words. The trees rushed past them outside in green blurs.  “I tell you everything I’ve done and you forgive me anyway and you’re the one thanking me,” Regulus whispered gulping. “I don’t deserve you. I still can’t believe you’re even real and here, in my life.”  “You’re not a bad person Regulus. Maybe you’ve done some bad things but you deserve love, you always deserve to be loved.” James reached over and pulled Regulus’ hand from the steering wheel. Gently, he kissed the inside of his wrist and then the palm of his hand as if he could press these truths right into Regulus to make him believe them, before pulling Regulus’ hand to rest on his cheek. James swore he could melt under his touch. "And I just think you're splendid." “James,” Regulus sighed, his eyes darting quickly over to James before returning to the road. “I will crash this fucking car.” His voice came out wavering and light.  James let go of Regulus’ hand so he could return to driving with both of them on the wheel and grinned.

He had experienced the love of a million lifetimes in the short amount of time he had known James. He had met the sun and known its warmth. It wasn’t a bad life.

It wasn’t the amount of blood that had accumulated all over the floor that convinced James that Regulus was dead.  Or the fact that Regulus had stopped the gurgling and wheezing noises several minutes ago as he drifted into cruel stillness.  It wasn’t Barty’s tear stained and blood splattered face. Or Evan’s desperate attempts to shake Regulus awake. It wasn’t even Peter’s sorrowful look upon checking for a pulse. Or his frantic attempts to do CPR anyway.   It was Sirius’ agonised wails as he pleaded and called out to a God he never believed in to spare his brother. To bring him back.  “I just got him back,” Sirius screamed. “I just got him back. Please. Don’t do this. Please bring him back. I just got him back.”

The only thing Regulus didn’t account for, was the fact that he wouldn’t be in it.

“What’s through those doors?”  “Possibilities. You and me and a million different lives all scattered throughout the cosmos. Lifetimes.” James eyed the doors warily. He wasn’t sure he wanted to give up this lifetime yet. This one and all it’s spectacular memories.  “I’ll let you in on a little secret,” Regulus whispered standing up and leading James to the row of doors. “I’ve had a long time to look through some of these doors. A long time to look at the lifetimes we still have waiting for us, and you’re going to love this one,” Regulus pointed to a short brown door with a golden handle. “It’s one of my favourites too.” James still wasn’t convinced.  “You want to know another secret, James? Out of all the doors I’ve looked in, I’ve yet to find one where we don’t meet. We always find each other, you and me.”  “In every lifetime?” “In every one.”

Barty, on the other hand, was the entertainment. He was the life of the conversations, always ready to crack a joke or get into trouble. In a life so dark and grey, he was constantly searching for the next good time, and if he couldn’t find it, he’d create it. Evan thought it was electrifying and refreshing to be around. So when Barty wanted trouble, Evan was always ready to help, always ready to follow him anywhere. Even if that meant prison, even if that meant dark alleyways with seedy men, even if that meant working for Selwyn for money when Barty ran away and Evan followed him just to get away from his father. There was something addicting about being in the presence of Barty Crouch Jr., and Evan couldn’t ever get enough.

Evan doesn’t know where they are going to be years from now, or what their ending looks like. Maybe they go out in a blaze of glory like he’d always imagined. One final cooked-up scheme that ended with them driving into the ocean or walking through the fires of some explosion they caused, all the while laughing maniacally with their heads thrown back– their joy indicating their lack of regret. Or maybe, if Evan was lucky, their ending looked something like this. A nice house, a sunny day, pictures of Elvis and Regulus on the fridge, a soft look from Barty, and all the love that held them together.  What a tender and curious thing that was to imagine.

We are all living, at most, half of a life, she thought. There was the life that you lived, which consisted of the choices you made. And then, there was the other life, the one that was the things you hadn’t chosen. And sometimes, this other life felt as palpable as the one you were living. Sometimes, it felt as if you might be walking down Brattle Street, and without warning, you could slip into this other life, like Alice falling down the rabbit hole that led to Wonderland. You would end up a different version of yourself, in some other town. But it wouldn’t be strange like Wonderland, not at all. Because you would have expected all along that it could have turned out that way. You would feel relief, because you had always wondered what that other life would have looked like. And there you were.

A sign in front of the field read: DO NOT SHOOT THE BISON. “I don’t remember encountering this field before,” Emily said. She went up to the fence and she let the bison sniff her hand. “When I was a child, I saw so many dead bison on the Oregon Trail, and I remember feeling outraged. People kill them because they are slow moving and easy to hunt, but then the meat just rots.”

Love and pain grew in a thorny grove inside me, impossible to disentangle from one another. And as I grew older, I withdrew into myself, becoming less brazen in my friendships. I learned to keep my hands to myself, to sit on them until they went numb or to dig my fingers into my palms until they bled. I learned how to guard my heart against the sweeping, heady sensation of a crush. I learned how to survive in the cutthroat world of girlhood, where all strangeness was unrooted as ruthlessly as weeds from a garden.

How often in his life he has found himself a frustrated observer of apparently impenetrable systems, watching other people participate effortlessly in structures he can find no way to enter or even understand. So often that it’s practically baseline, just normal existence for him. And this is not only due to the irrational nature of other people, and the consequent irrationality of the rules and processes they devise; it’s due to Ivan himself, his fundamental unsuitedness to life. He knows this. He feels himself to have been formed, somehow, with something other than life in mind.

Her touch was light, almost shy, in sharp contrast to her merciless grip around my wrists. “I think I love you too,” she whispered, then that mischievous expression was back. “But we’ll see how you feel once I’m done with you.”

The absence of blood on my wedding night – Henry searching for it on the sheets in the morning, and finding none, pricking my finger on a penknife to smear a bright stain for the servants to find and know he had done his husbandly duty. The blood that came each month after. At first, a disappointment, then a fear, then a grief, then an inevitability. I was good for nothing but blood.

I understand what you’re saying, he says. But sexuality, speaking broadly, it’s more complicated than that. I mean, it’s not just the one physical act. She breathes out between her lips as if considering. In theory, she says. But practically speaking, people have expectations about what an intimate relationship will involve. She breaks off here a moment, teeth at her lower lip, and then adds: I suppose it’s my personality as well. You know, if I can’t do something properly, I don’t want to do it at all. Maybe that’s part of the problem, I don’t know. I think I would find it humiliating, having to negotiate all that with another person. I would feel I was offering something very inferior.

Getting up in the dark and going to the yard, making the deliveries, one after another, the whole day long, then coming home in the dark and trying to wash the black off himself and sitting into a dinner at the table and falling asleep before waking in the dark to meet a version of the same thing, yet again. Might things never change or develop into something else, or new?

Occasionally when I prepare a meal, as I do several times most days, I resent clearing away the dishes. And sometimes when I try to get the duvet in its cover, I feel a pathetic sense of unfairness that it is only me who has responsibility for it. And when there are issues to resolve – a broken boiler, a leaking tap, an unexpected bill – I know the flaring up of my irritation and presumed helplessness is stirred not only by inconvenience but by a roaming sadness that needs a grievance to attach itself to. I have always wanted a home that felt like I wanted romantic love to feel – warm, intimate, symbolic in all the aesthetic details of it, and after the inevitable addictive whirr of lust, secure.

Now he thinks he probably has been too hard on himself, which isn’t at all what his dad would have wanted. No: his dad loved him, and wanted him to be happy, he knows that. And if he can be happy now, it’s not betraying his dad’s memory, as he has sometimes felt, but in fact abiding by his strongest wishes, his wishes for his children’s happiness.

Does it make sense to think this way, in terms of moving forces? Like the feeling Ivan had for his father has nowhere to go anymore, like it’s lodged inside him, unexpressed. In the weeks since his father died Ivan has not heard these words from anyone, I love you, or said them to anyone either. Does this explain his intense longing to hear and say them again, to relieve the pressure of this confined force inside his body? Even to think of Margaret with love gives a little relief, to allow the feeling of love into his thoughts, like a flower opening outwards inside his mind.

A rite of passage – we’re moving in together – feels remote not just because I’m single, but because I’m unsure how able I am to co-create a home, to be moderated by another’s aesthetic and practical needs and wants. I don’t think this unyielding creature is who I want to be. *

I try to think of the kitchen as a theatre of self-creation. Sometimes it’s as simple as putting pickles in a pretty dish and laying the table. Or slicing up fruit and arranging it on a plate that makes the colours vibrate. Other times it’s the rejection of restraint when cooking for one. I always feel defensive when people say ‘I don’t bother when it’s just me.’ It’s not that I don’t value convenience and simplicity – I love supermarket tortellini and instant noodles as much as anyone – but I infer from their words that they don’t think I am worth it.

I feel a swell of pleasure that I don’t have to contend with the aesthetic veto of ‘the other half’. At least in my situation I haven’t had my taste neutralised into an unthreatening, benign palette by the need for compromise. This allows my dreams for a potential future home to be uninhibited, to know I might – budget aside – indulge every fussy and prim little detail of my fancy.

Conflicting Feelings About Men You can really, genuinely have warm, positive, strong feelings towards men and they can still be compulsory heterosexuality. Compulsory heterosexuality is the assumption that any feelings that you have towards a man MUST be attraction because society talks all the time about hetero love and attraction so when you feel something towards a man you think “oh, this must be what it’s like”. Then as part of “discovering your sexuality” you try to find ways that you find men attractive. You think “i’m not attracted to physical appearance, only personalities” or “i only like feminine men

. ● I like the idea of marrying a man/being in a relationship with a man, but I can always pick out a reason to not want to date any man that is interested in me or any man suggested to me. These reasons are sometimes reasonable, but often insignificant (i.e. “I don’t like guys who do their hair like that, he has a weird mole on his face, he’s too tall”). ● I can fantasize about men and find men attractive, but thinking about realistically ​ being with a man makes my stomach churn. ● Only developing attraction to a guy after a female friend expresses attraction to him ● I like getting attention from men and being validated in my attractiveness, but the moment it goes from attention to an interaction (i.e. from flirting to asking out) I start panicking. ● Getting jealous of a specific female friend’s relationships with guys and assuming you must be attracted to the guys she’s with (even if you never really noticed them before she was interested in them) ● You view relationships with men as a chore, burden, or just something you must deal with. ● Confusing a strong emotional connection/dependency with a man for romantic feelings, can be due to mental illness. ● You get crushes on just about every guy you’re friendly with, because there’s really no difference between friendships and crushes to you ● You feel like you could theoretically be attracted to men (you may even have fantasies about them), but in practice you never have any feelings for them. ● Picking a guy at random to be attracted to

Compulsory Heterosexuality: You imagine a hypothetical future where you end up with a man and it makes you feel uncomfortable, scared, sad, disappointed, wrong. It’s an upsetting thing to think about and you hope it doesn’t happen. You don’t want to end up with a man even if you feel like you could.

Some people’s orientation includes sexual attraction and some people’s orientation doesn’t, but most of us feel like our sexual fantasies are the most important indicator of non-straight sexuality because LGBT people have been so thoroughly reduced to sexual acts and sexual objects in the homophobic culture we’ve grown up in.

even if you are ​attracted to men, you do not need to date them if you don’t want to. If you only want to date other women, then you have the right to that. The rest is less important than the simple reality of what you want right now

You don’t want to date men, but you feel like you have to. ● You think that because you could survive dating, marrying, and/or having sex with a man, you’re attracted to men (hint: you don’t have to settle for just surviving).

Men expressing their attraction to men is more relatable than women expressing their attraction for men (there’s something specific about same-gender attraction that any form of it is just more relatable than different gender attraction)

Well, I’m sorry about that. But I think, as sad as it is to say, I think people aren’t always very nice to the people they love. Ivan exhales now, a quick frustrated kind of laughter. Okay, he says. What does it mean to love someone, then? I’m curious. If you don’t care about the person’s feelings, and you’re not nice to them, and you don’t really want them to be happy, how is that love, in your opinion?

Sadness, missing his father, and a kind of shame somehow, because each passing day seemed to bring Ivan further away from him and the life they used to have together, a life that was receding increasingly into the past, into the realm of childhood and adolescence. The realisation that his adulthood, into which he was entering now so definitively, and which would last all the rest of his life, would have to be lived without his father. That he was becoming a person his father would never know.

But I do wish the culture I grew up in, and the white, hetero culture I’m funnelled into, was not so unimaginative and hierarchical in its ability to recognise other life transitions that might be worth marking. Without this openness from others, it takes a person who is willing to make a fuss of their own life to have their occasions noted. Or that noting becomes a private act that no one else can acknowledge, because to celebrate oneself is shameful, greedy, undignified behaviour. What are we missing of our friends’ and family members’ lives that are every bit as important as a change in legal status or the growth of a family? I fear it’s so many things.

When I love a song, there is almost always a moment that sounds like how I imagine truth to sound, were truth something you could only experience through sound. It’s the moment in the song that touches the bruise you didn’t know you had, the aching, denied part of you. You are found out by it.

Sometimes an hour will go by and he won’t even come into my head. The honest truth. The hour is gone before I even think about him. But that’s normal, she says. When someone you love is still alive, you don’t think about that person every hour of the day either. Because a living person has their own reality, he says. The person who’s gone has no reality anymore, except in thoughts. And once they’re gone from thoughts, they actually are completely gone. If I don’t think about him, literally, I’m ending his existence. Low and insistent her voice answering: No, you’re really not.

Ivan had seemed at first, she thought, like a way for her to leave the bad feelings behind, an open gate leading out into another kind of life, free of all the remorse and unhappiness she had accumulated before. Now she was beginning to see that he could also be a source of these same bad feelings, unhappiness, remorse, that he was not going to retain always the new fresh unencumbered quality he had presented to her when first they met. His life also was littered with difficulty, just as hers was, and these difficulties did not dissolve on contact, but rather seemed to coagulate and harden.
