He will go there one day, James thinks suddenly. He'll go there, and stand where Teddy stood. Where countless thousands have stood before them. Where wars have been waged, and bombs dropped, and castles besieged. Where countless photographs have been taken, and memories forged, and lifetime experiences made. And somewhere, in this great timeline of history, in this vast ocean of wars and battles and celebrations, a boy sent another boy a postcard. I was standing atop this rock today, James.

Artists mixing colours and creating scenes that have never been done before, writers giving words to emotions that everyone feels but can’t describe, musicians creating chords and melodies out of silence.

I loved and cried and sang and danced once just like you. I was here. I was human. Remember me. Remember me.’

Or Evan’s desperate attempts to shake Regulus awake. It wasn’t even Peter’s sorrowful look upon checking for a pulse. Or his frantic attempts to do CPR anyway.   It was Sirius’ agonised wails as he pleaded and called out to a God he never believed in to spare his brother.

Or maybe, if Evan was lucky, their ending looked something like this.

You live here.” “I — I can’t ask that.” James scoffed. “You’re not asking, I’m telling. You’re not going back there. You’re not camping out at the Leaky Cauldron. You — live — here.”

Why is it that even the best of men always seem to hide something from other people and to keep something back?
