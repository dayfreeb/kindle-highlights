He will go there one day, James thinks suddenly. He'll go there, and stand where Teddy stood. Where countless thousands have stood before them. Where wars have been waged, and bombs dropped, and castles besieged. Where countless photographs have been taken, and memories forged, and lifetime experiences made. And somewhere, in this great timeline of history, in this vast ocean of wars and battles and celebrations, a boy sent another boy a postcard. I was standing atop this rock today, James.

“Yeah, we’re going to Hogsmeade.” “What’s her name?” James stares at him blankly. “God, I don’t know,” he says with realisation. “I’ve got no idea.” “What?” “Scorpius, help me.”

"Her cousin's name is James. She said it felt too weird when she called my name during — " "No!" " — during swim practice." Rose hits him on the arm. "Very funny, you complete prat!" He grins. "Why? What did you think I was going to say?" She reddens. "You're so mean. I don't know why I talk to you sometimes. You know, I'm doing you a huge favour — " "Yes, thanks for the seventeen ex-girlfriends."

”Almost exactly six years ago,” he says, “I was about to begin my first year at Hogwarts. I was sitting in an empty train compartment feeling completely alone. And then a boy walked into the compartment and introduced himself.” Scorpius waits. Draco doesn’t speak. ”James,” Scorpius says. “The moment I saw him, that was it. Head over heels. I knew I would never, ever want anyone else. And I was right.”
